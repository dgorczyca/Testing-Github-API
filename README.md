# Testing-Github-API

Create an interactive page that uses the GitHub API to demonstrate the variety of programming languages 
they use across their repositories. 
Technologies used:<ul>
Java <br />
Lombok to save myself writing boilerplate code<br />
HTTP libraries (Spring's HTTP library)<br />
JUnit to test Jackson's object mapping<br />
</ul>

Web frameworks:
<ul>
Spring Boot for backend (Spring web)<br />
For HTML I am planning to use https://mdbootstrap.com/javascript/charts/ for pie charts for the repositories<br />
</ul>

So far I have prepared a mini library for handling GitHub API. <br />
At this point I am able to collect all the repositories and all the languages.<br />
Next step will be to prepare a mini domain report class which will help holding data. <br />
This is the Maven project and holds all Maven's conventions.<br /> 
JUnit tests were written to confirm JSON that comes back from GitHub gets correctly mapped.
